        <h6>Integration and Optimization of IoT- Enabled Systems for Adopting Supply Chain Industry 4.0 Technologies</h6>
        <p> <b>Abstract:</b> It is widely accepted that systems in the very near future require a real-time visibility of inventory data in
        order to maintain efficient and effective system operations. As there are innumerable devices connected to the Internet
        which interact with each other, providing services to users that, until a few years ago, seemed unthinkable. The areas
        of immediate interest will be range from proper maintenance of record-keeping levels, modern inventory management and
        control of products, and incoming and outgoing transactions that occur in the domains od education, health care, law and
        order, and services that a person is currently carrying out in many aspects of life. The use of phones by everyone to
        everyone has led to tremendous increase in these activities, which when connected to the internet or with each other,
        enter a huge amount of data for transactions over the phone, desktop, internet and cloud environment. This emerging
        trend has led to a sharp rise in shopping trends in many countries as customers prefer buying goods online over the
        traditional shopping style. More than ever, the need for the ordered products directly to customers at their door steps
        with fast delivery has been recognized. The open research question has been how to design an inventory management system
        capable of interacting with an RFID-enabled storage and retrieval mechanism without any human intervention. This is in
        response to a strong desire and need from supply chain and logistic sectors to seek for more efficient and
        cost-effective ways to sort, store, pick and dispatch goods through RFID-enabled central distribution centers. The
        results demonstrate that the developed management system will prove useful in determining the optimal solution in
        pushing an RFID-tagged item from the storage rack to the output conveyor system in a sequence. The proposed ideas can
        also be extended by incorporating user-defined parametric optimization for integration into a very large application
        system vis-à-vis the industry 4.0 scenari</p>

        <h6>6G Communication Networks: Needs, Challenges and Future Communication Technologies</h6>
        <p> <b>Abstract:</b> Internet of everything (IoE)-based smart services are expected to gain immense popularity in the future, which
        raises the need for next-generation wireless networks. However, 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) will be unable to provide the
        complete requirements of the Internet of Everything (IoE), even that 5G networks can support various IoE services, they
        might not be able to completely full-fill the requirements of novel applications. Moreover, in spite of the fact that 5G
        is still in the underlying phase of commercial scale, it is also look forward to the communication needs of the future
        information society and start the idea and technology research for the next generation mobile communication system.
        Therefore, there is a high demand for 6G. The 6G will revolutionize personal life, lifestyle, society, business and
        communication systems. It is a crucial time to envision the potential applications, techniques, use cases, and
        challenges of 6G technology. Noteworthy, 6G will create enormous research possibilities and enable many new
        technologies. Moreover, the 6G will be proven as a game changer paradigm in diverse fields. 6G wireless systems are
        envisioned to overcome 5G network limitations, a taxonomy based on key enabling technologies, use cases, emerging
        machine learning schemes, communication technologies, networking technologies, and computing technologies. These key
        enabling technologies will aim to compete challenges and issues in the way to 6G. These include terabit data
        transmission system, 3D networks paradigm, availability and reliability, intelligent radio and distributed AI. A 6G
        mobile network system requires to deliver extremely fast speed, increase capacity then non-proximity in order to support
        the likelihood of fresh applications, as vigorous medicine, computer disaster forecasting plus virtual reality (VR). 6G
        should promote wireless technologies such as the use an advanced frequency spectrum than preceding generations to
        advance the data throughput estimated at 100 to 1000 times quicker than 5G. 6G systems will let hundreds of GBs per
        second to connect to the second using broadband spectrum; for instance, the combined usage of a band from 1 to 3 GHz, a
        millimeter wave band (mm wave) (30 to 300 GHz) and a terahertz band (0.06 to 10 THz). In the spatial dimension, to
        benefit more from multi-channel, MIMO residue techniques (PM-MIMO), as the ultra-huge MIMO (UM-MIMO) for terahertz
        communication, can help hundreds or thousands of antennas to transmit / receive. 6G with Satellite Network The 6G mobile
        system for global coverage will be coordinated 5G mobile wireless system plus the satellite network. Finally, Cell less
        Architecture for 6G Networks following generation wireless networks have to assist an enormous figure of terminal users
        within minor geographical extents, and this will stretch increase to dense or ultra-dense placement of APs/BSs with
        overlapping coverage zones.</p>
